# React Application with Axios - Best Practices for API Handling

This React application demonstrates best practices for handling API requests using Axios. It utilizes a **class-based approach** to organize API calls, encapsulating logic for each service in separate classes. The application is designed for efficient token management, automatic token refreshing, API request retries, and comprehensive error handling.

## Features

### 1. **Class-Based API Handling**

- The API logic is structured around **classes**, making it easier to manage multiple API services.
- Each service (like `WeatherApi`) has its own class that handles API requests, URL construction, and error handling, improving code maintainability and readability.

### 2. **Axios Interceptors for API Requests**

- Global Axios configuration with interceptors that automatically include the `Authorization` token in request headers.
- Request and response interceptors ensure consistent API calls and seamless token expiration handling.

### 3. **Token Management and Refresh**

- When a `401 Unauthorized` error is encountered, the app will attempt to refresh the authentication token.
- The failed request is retried automatically with the new token, preventing the user from being logged out unexpectedly.

### 4. **Retry Logic for Expired Tokens**

- If the token has expired, the request is retried after the token is refreshed.
- This ensures users experience minimal disruption when their tokens expire.

### 5. **Error Handling**

- Global error handling is in place to catch and manage errors from failed API requests, providing informative error messages and improving the overall user experience.

## Setup

### 1. **Install Dependencies**

Ensure that `axios` is installed in your project. You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install axios
```
